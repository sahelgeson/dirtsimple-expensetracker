# Dirt Simple Expense Tracker

This app was designed to be a simple way to keep track of expenses made "on the go". (Coffee, snacks, groceries, etc.)
It's a mobile web app, accessible at http://dirtsimpleexpensetracker.com/, designed for mobile devices. All data is 
stored in localStorage and is only saved on the user's device. There's no sharing with the cloud, no signup, no one
else looking at your expenses.

Currently users can:
* Enter in expenses and choose a category
* Edit expenses on the "All Expenses" page
* Edit categories available on the "Options" page

Features planned for the near future:
* Import/Export data via a file
* Change the order of categories in selects
* Possibly filters by amount/category on the All Expenses and statistics


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
